      <p>
        Thank you for participating in this research survey. You will be asked
        to evaluate different styles of hotel review summaries to help us
        understand which summaries travelers find most helpful when making
        booking decisions. The survey will take approximately 5 minutes to
        complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        The survey will start with a few questions about your travel habits and
        preferences, followed by tasks where you'll review and compare different
        review summaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your responses will remain confidential and will be used solely for
        academic research purposes. Upon completing the survey, you will receive
        a payment of $0.75.

        Welcome to "User Preferences for Review Summaries," a web-based survey
        that examines what styles of review summaries are preferred for
        different hotels. Before taking part in this study, please read the
        consent form below and click on the "I Agree" button at the bottom of
        the page if you understand the statements and freely consent to
        participate in the study.
      </p>
      <h1>Consent Form</h1>
      <p>
        This study involves a web-based survey designed to examine what styles
        of review summaries are preferred for different hotels. The study has
        been designated by The University of Texas at Dallas Office of Human
        Subjects Protections (OHSP) as exempt from review by an Institutional
        Review Board. No deception is involved, and the study involves no more
        than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered
        in daily life).
      </p>
      <p>
        Participation in the study typically takes 5 minutes and is strictly
        confidential. Participants begin by answer a few question related to
        their hotel booking experience and then choose the review summaries that
        they think are most helpful in making a hotel booking decision and the
        reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        All responses are treated as confidential, and in no case will responses
        from individual participants be identified. Rather, all data will be
        pooled and published in aggregate form only. Participants should be
        aware that while the experiment is being run from a "secure" https
        server of the kind typically used to handle credit card transactions,
        there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by
        unauthorized third parties (e.g., computer hackers).
      </p>
      <p>Participants will receive $0.75.</p>
      <p>
        Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves
        no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise
        entitled, and participants may withdraw from the study at any time
        without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise
        entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
        If participants have further questions about this study, they may
        contact the Principal Investigator, Luoying Chen at
        luoying.chen@utdallas.edu; Participants who want more information about
        their rights as a participant or who want to report a research related
        concern may contact The University of Texas at Dallas Office of Human
        Subjects Protections at (972) 883-4575 or HSP@utdallas.edu.
